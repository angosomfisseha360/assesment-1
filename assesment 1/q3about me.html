    <p>O my dearest, fairest, and most beloved,
        The light of my life, the joy of my heart,
        How can I express the love that I feel for thee,
        In words that are worthy of such a start?</p>
    <p>O my dearest, fairest, and most beloved,
        The light of my life, the joy of my heart,
        How can I express the love that I feel for thee,
        In words that are worthy of such a start?</p>
    <p>I am so grateful to have thee in my life,
        To be able to share my days with thee,
        To know that I am loved by thee,
        Is the greatest gift that I could ever receive</p>
<p>So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,,<br>
    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</p>
